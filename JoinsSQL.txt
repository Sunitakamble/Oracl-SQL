INNER JOIN -

An INNER JOIN in SQL is a type of join that retrieves records from two or more tables based on a related column between them. When you perform an INNER JOIN, only the rows that have matching values in both tables are included in the result set.

ex. inner join(x,y)

1 x1    1 y1

2 x2    2 y2

3 x3    4 y4





left Join-
A LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN) in Oracle SQL retrieves all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table. If there are no matches, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.


1   x1    1 y1

2   x2    2 y2

3   x3    


Right join-
In Oracle SQL, a RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN) retrieves all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table. If there are no matches, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.


1 x1    1 y1

2 x2    2 y2

        4 y4


Full join- 
In Oracle SQL, a FULL OUTER JOIN (or simply FULL JOIN) retrieves all records from both the left and right tables. If there is no match between the two tables, NULL values are returned for the columns from the table that does not have a match.
